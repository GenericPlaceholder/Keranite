# Keranite
## Take Matters Into Your Own Hands
Adds a new material, **Keranite**, which can be used to not only reinforce netherite armor to make it stronger, but also forge new, powerful weapons with unique abilities and enchants and useful items.

**---**

This is heavily inspired by [Amarite](https://modrinth.com/mod/amarite), except with the focus being on slowing movement and dealing damage rather than movement abilities and taking damage.

I'm also incredibly new to modding Minecraft, so my code will probably be awful.

If the commits are messy, that's just because I'm also new to using GitHub and Git.
