# Keranite
## Harness the Wrath of Zeus

Putting the edginess to the side, this is a mod that is heavily inspired by [Amarite](https://modrinth.com/mod/amarite), except with the focus being on dealing damage rather than movement/taking damage.
That's all so far, but more will be decided.

I'm also incredibly new to modding Minecraft, so my code will probably be awful.

By the way, if the commits are messy, that's just because I'm also new to using GitHub and Git.
